# Custom-ESP32-Board

## Introduction
This is where I keep all my files and progress for my custom ESP32 board design and assembly on Altium Designer. 

## Log
1. Find the ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 manual on EspressIF's DevKits. Downloaded manual and schematic for the MINI-1
2. Identify components in schematic and find in Digikey. Find the manufactuer's numbers to search for components on LCSC Electronics to import component information into Altium's Manufacturer's Part Search
3. Create new component in SCH Library and import LCSC part number. Create component.
4. Import components into main schematic and refer to EspressIF's schematic to make connections
